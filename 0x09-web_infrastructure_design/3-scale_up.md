A ```web server‘s``` fundamental job is to accept and fulfill requests from clients for static content from a website (HTML pages, files, images, video, and so on). The client is almost always a browser or mobile application and the request takes the form of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) message, as does the web server’s response.

An ```application server’s``` fundamental job is to provide its clients with access to what is commonly called business logic, which generates dynamic content; that is, it’s code that transforms data to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application. An application server’s clients are often applications themselves, and can include web servers and other application servers. Communication between the application server and its clients might take the form of HTTP messages, but that is not required as it is for communication between web servers and their clients. Many other protocols are popular, including the variants of CGI.


## How Do Application Servers and Web Servers Work Together?
In a typical deployment, a website that provides both static and dynamically generated content runs web servers for the static content and application servers to generate content dynamically. A reverse proxy and load balancer sit in front of one or more web servers and one or more web application servers to route traffic to the appropriate server, first based on the type of content requested and then based on the configured load-balancing algorithm. Most load balancer programs are also reverse proxy servers, which simplifies web application server architecture.
